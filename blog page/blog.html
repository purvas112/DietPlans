            <p class="text">
              The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein,
              low-carbohydrate dietary therapy that in conventional medicine is
              used mainly to treat hard-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in
              children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than
              carbohydrates. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Normally carbohydrates in food are converted into glucose, which
              is then transported around the body and is important in fueling
              brain function. However, if only a little carbohydrate remains in
              the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone
              bodies, the latter passing into the brain and replacing glucose as
              an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood
              (a state called ketosis) eventually lowers the frequency of
              epileptic seizures
            </p>

            <div class="border">
              <p class="text">
                Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have
                tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by
                at least half, and the effect persists after discontinuing the
                diet
              </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
              The original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides
              just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient
              calories[Note 1] to maintain the correct weight for age and
              height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for
              treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used
              into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the
              introduction of effective anticonvulsant medications
            </p>

            <h3 class="subhead">History</h3>
            <p class="text">
              The ketogenic diet is a mainstream medical dietary therapy that
              was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations
              of the non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subhead">Fasting</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Physicians of ancient Greece treated diseases, including epilepsy,
              by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the
              Hippocratic Corpus, On the Sacred Disease, covers the disease; it
              dates from c. 400 BC.

              <p class="text">
                The first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy
                was in France in 1911.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
              Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were "detoxified" by
              consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of
              fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to
              maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions.

            <p class="text">
              In 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and
              diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds,
              β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone (known collectively
              as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy
              people when they were starved or if they consumed a very
              low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood
              </li>
              <li>a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely.</li>
              <li>the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              Wilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later
              formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein
              per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15 g of carbohydrate
              per day, and the remainder of calories from fat.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The diet proved to be very successful in children.</li>
              <li>
                the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults.
              </li>
              <li>
                the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text">
              During the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs
              were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital
              (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied.
